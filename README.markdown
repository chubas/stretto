Stretto
=======

Stretto is Ruby's implementation of [JFugue][1], an open source library originally written in Java by [David Koelle][2] for programming MIDI.

Motivation
----------

JFugue's syntax is great for producing both a human readable and parseable implementation of the MIDI specification. By detaching it from the Java sound engine, it can become an specification and be implemented in several languages/platforms. This implementation aims to be compatible with JFugue as well as serve as the basis for the format specification.
